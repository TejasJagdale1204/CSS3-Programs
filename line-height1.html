    <h2>Information of HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure webpages. 
        It provides the basic building blocks of web content by using tags and elements to define headings, 
        paragraphs, links, images, tables, and more. HTML works alongside CSS (for styling) and 
        JavaScript (for interactivity) to build modern websites. Every webpage is essentially an HTML 
        document that web browsers interpret and display. HTML uses a simple tag-based structure, where most 
        elements come in pairs: an opening tag <tag> and a closing tag </tag>. It has evolved over time, with 
        HTML5 offering multimedia support, semantic tags, and better accessibility.

    <h2>Information of CSS</h2>
    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design and format the appearance of 
        HTML elements on a webpage. It controls layout, colors, fonts, spacing, backgrounds, and overall 
        visual presentation. CSS allows developers to separate content (HTML) from design, making websites more 
        organized and easier to maintain. Styles can be applied inline, internally within the HTML file, or externally 
        using a separate .css file. CSS supports selectors, classes, and IDs to target specific elements. 
        Modern CSS includes features like Flexbox and Grid for responsive layouts, media queries for adaptability, 
        and animations for dynamic effects, enhancing user experience significantly.

    <h2>Information of JS</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language mainly used to make websites interactive and dynamic.
        It runs directly in web browsers, allowing developers to create features like form validation, animations, sliders, pop-ups, 
        and real-time updates without reloading pages. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript forms the core of web development. 
        It supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming. Modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) introduced 
        features like arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules. It also powers popular frameworks and libraries such as React, 
        Angular, and Node.js. Beyond the browser, JavaScript is widely used in server-side development, mobile apps, and game development.
